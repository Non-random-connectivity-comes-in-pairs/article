  abstract =      {Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate
                   that can be dynamically and arbitrarily molded by
                   experience. However, when we investigated synaptic
                   connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the
                   neocortex, we found that both connectivity and
                   synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable.
                   Synaptic weights follow very closely the number of
                   connections in a group of neurons, saturating after
                   only 20\% of possible connections are formed between
                   neurons in a group. When we examined the network
                   topology of connectivity between neurons, we found
                   that the neurons cluster into small world networks
                   that are not scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of
                   separation. We found a simple clustering rule where
                   connectivity is directly proportional to the number
                   of common neighbors, which accounts for these small
                   world networks and accurately predicts the connection
                   probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal
                   neuron network clusters into multiple groups of a few
                   dozen neurons each. The neurons composing each group
                   are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100
                   \ensuremath{\mu}m apart, allowing for multiple groups
                   to be interlaced in the same space. In summary, we
                   discovered a synaptic organizing principle that
                   groups neurons in a manner that is common across
                   animals and hence, independent of individual
                   experiences. We speculate that these elementary
                   neuronal groups are prescribed Lego-like building
                   blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies
                   more on combining these elementary assemblies into
                   higher-order constructs.},

                   adjacent, synaptically connected thick tufted layer 5
                   pyramidal neurones in brain slices of young rat
                   (14-16 days) somatosensory cortex to examine the
                   physiological properties of unitary EPSPs. Pre- and
                   postsynaptic neurones were filled with biocytin and
                   examined in the light and electron microscope to
                   quantify the morphology of axonal and dendritic
                   arbors and the number and location of synaptic
                   contacts on the target neurone. 2. In 138 synaptic
                   connections between pairs of pyramidal neurones 96
                   (70\%) were unidirectional and 42 (30\%) were
                   bidirectional. The probability of finding a synaptic
                   connection in dual recordings was 0.1. Unitary EPSPs
                   evoked by a single presynaptic action potential (AP)
                   had a mean peak amplitude ranging from 0.15 to 5.5 mV
                   in different connections with a mean of 1.3 +/- 1.1
                   mV, a latency of 1.7 +/- 0.9 ms, a 20-80\% rise time
                   of 2.9 +/- 2.3 ms and a decay time constant of 40 +/-
                   18 ms at 32-24 degrees C and -60 +/- 2 mV membrane
                   potential. 3. Peak amplitudes of unitary EPSPs
                   fluctuated randomly from trial to trial. The
                   coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the unitary EPSP
                   amplitudes ranged from 0.13 to 2.8 in different
                   synaptic connections (mean, 0.52; median, 0.41). The
                   percentage of failures of single APs to evoke a
                   unitary EPSP ranged from 0 to 73\% (mean, 14\%;
                   median, 7\%). Both c.v. and percentage of failures
                   decreased with increasing mean EPSP amplitude. 4.
                   Postsynaptic glutamate receptors which mediate
                   unitary EPSPs at -60 mV were predominantly of the
                       L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
  (AMPA) receptor type. Receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type
  contributed only a small fraction (\ensuremath{<} 20\%) to the voltage-time
  integral of the unitary EPSP at -60 mV, but their contribution increased at
  more positive membrane potentials. 5. Branching patterns of dendrites and
  axon collaterals of forty-five synaptically connected neurones, when examined
  in the light microscope, indicated that the axonal and dendritic anatomy of
  both projecting and target neurones and of uni- and bidirectionally connected
  neurones was uniform. 6. The number of potential synaptic contacts formed by
  a presynaptic neurone on a target neurone varied between four and eight
  (mean, 5.5 +/- 1.1 contacts; n = 19 connections). Synaptic contacts were
  preferentially located on basal dendrites (63\%, 82 +/- 35 microns from the
  soma, n = 67) and apical oblique dendrites (27\%, 145 +/- 59 microns, n =
  29), and 35\% of all contacts were located on tertiary basal dendritic
  branches. The mean geometric distances (from the soma) of the contacts of a
  connection varied between 80 and 585 microns (mean, 147 microns; median, 105
  microns). The correlation between EPSP amplitude and the number of
  morphologically determined synaptic contacts or the mean geometric distances
  from the soma was only weak (correlation coefficients were 0.2 and 0.26,
  respectively). 7. Compartmental models constructed from camera lucida
  drawings of eight target neurones showed that synaptic contacts were located
  at mean electrotonic distances between 0.07 and 0.33 from the soma (mean,
  0.13). Simulations of unitary EPSPs, assuming quantal conductance changes
  with fast rise time and short duration, indicated that amplitudes of quantal
  EPSPs at the soma were attenuated, on average, to \ensuremath{<} 10\% of
  dendritic EPSPs and varied in amplitude up to 10-fold depending on the
  dendritic location of synaptic contacts. The inferred quantal peak
  conductance increase varied between 1.5 and 5.5 nS (mean, 3 nS). 8. The
  combined physiological and morphological measurements in conjunction with
  EPSP simulations indicated that the 20-fold range in efficacy of the synaptic
  connections between thick tufted pyramidal neurones, which have their
  synaptic contacts preferentially located on basal and apical oblique
  dendrites, was due to differences in transmitter release probability of the
  projecting neurones and, to a lesser extent, to differenc},

                   often have a few strong connections, which are
                   sometimes bidirectional, among a lot of weak
                   connections. To explain these connectivity patterns,
                   we created a model of spike
                   timing\textendash{}dependent plasticity (STDP) in
                   which synaptic changes depend on presynaptic spike
                   arrival and the postsynaptic membrane potential,
                   filtered with two different time constants. Our model
                   describes several nonlinear effects that are observed
                   in STDP experiments, as well as the voltage
                   dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a
                   simulated recurrent network of spiking neurons, our
                   plasticity rule led not only to development of
                   localized receptive fields but also to connectivity
                   patterns that reflect the neural code. For temporal
                   coding procedures with spatio-temporal input
                   correlations, strong connections were predominantly
                   unidirectional, whereas they were bidirectional under
                   rate-coded input with spatial correlations only.
                   Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain
                   could reflect different coding principles across
                   brain areas; moreover, our simulations suggested that
                   plasticity is fast.},

                   the C2 barrel column of mouse primary somatosensory
                   cortex. This cortical column is known to process
                   tactile information related to the C2 whisker.
                   Through multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings,

                   excitatory neurons located across all cortical layers
                   of the C2 barrel column. Synaptic connectivity
