  abstract =      {Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate
                   that can be dynamically and arbitrarily molded by
                   experience. However, when we investigated synaptic
                   connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the
                   neocortex, we found that both connectivity and
                   synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable.
                   Synaptic weights follow very closely the number of
                   connections in a group of neurons, saturating after
                   only 20\% of possible connections are formed between
                   neurons in a group. When we examined the network
                   topology of connectivity between neurons, we found
                   that the neurons cluster into small world networks
                   that are not scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of
                   separation. We found a simple clustering rule where
                   connectivity is directly proportional to the number
                   of common neighbors, which accounts for these small
                   world networks and accurately predicts the connection
                   probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal
                   neuron network clusters into multiple groups of a few
                   dozen neurons each. The neurons composing each group
                   are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100
                   $\mu$m apart, allowing for multiple groups to be
                   interlaced in the same space. In summary, we
                   discovered a synaptic organizing principle that
                   groups neurons in a manner that is common across
                   animals and hence, independent of individual
                   experiences. We speculate that these elementary
                   neuronal groups are prescribed Lego-like building
                   blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies
                   more on combining these elementary assemblies into
                   higher-order constructs.},

                   adjacent, synaptically connected thick tufted layer 5
                   pyramidal neurones in brain slices of young rat
                   (14-16 days) somatosensory cortex to examine the
                   physiological properties of unitary EPSPs. Pre- and
                   postsynaptic neurones were filled with biocytin and
                   examined in the light and electron microscope to
                   quantify the morphology of axonal and dendritic
                   arbors and the number and location of synaptic
                   contacts on the target neurone. 2. In 138 synaptic
                   connections between pairs of pyramidal neurones 96
                   (70\%) were unidirectional and 42 (30\%) were
                   bidirectional. The probability of finding a synaptic
                   connection in dual recordings was 0.1. Unitary EPSPs
                   evoked by a single presynaptic action potential (AP)
                   had a mean peak amplitude ranging from 0.15 to 5.5 mV
                   in different connections with a mean of 1.3 +/- 1.1
                   mV, a latency of 1.7 +/- 0.9 ms, a 20-80\% rise time
                   of 2.9 +/- 2.3 ms and a decay time constant of 40 +/-
                   18 ms at 32-24 degrees C and -60 +/- 2 mV membrane
                   potential. 3. Peak amplitudes of unitary EPSPs
                   fluctuated randomly from trial to trial. The
                   coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the unitary EPSP
                   amplitudes ranged from 0.13 to 2.8 in different
                   synaptic connections (mean, 0.52; median, 0.41). The
                   percentage of failures of single APs to evoke a
                   unitary EPSP ranged from 0 to 73\% (mean, 14\%;
                   median, 7\%). Both c.v. and percentage of failures
                   decreased with increasing mean EPSP amplitude. 4.
                   Postsynaptic glutamate receptors which mediate
                   unitary EPSPs at -60 mV were predominantly of the
                       L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
  (AMPA) receptor type. Receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type
  contributed only a small fraction ($<$ 20\%) to the voltage-time integral of
  the unitary EPSP at -60 mV, but their contribution increased at more positive
  membrane potentials. 5. Branching patterns of dendrites and axon collaterals
  of forty-five synaptically connected neurones, when examined in the light
  microscope, indicated that the axonal and dendritic anatomy of both
  projecting and target neurones and of uni- and bidirectionally connected
  neurones was uniform. 6. The number of potential synaptic contacts formed by
  a presynaptic neurone on a target neurone varied between four and eight
  (mean, 5.5 +/- 1.1 contacts; n = 19 connections). Synaptic contacts were
  preferentially located on basal dendrites (63\%, 82 +/- 35 microns from the
  soma, n = 67) and apical oblique dendrites (27\%, 145 +/- 59 microns, n =
  29), and 35\% of all contacts were located on tertiary basal dendritic
  branches. The mean geometric distances (from the soma) of the contacts of a
  connection varied between 80 and 585 microns (mean, 147 microns; median, 105
  microns). The correlation between EPSP amplitude and the number of
  morphologically determined synaptic contacts or the mean geometric distances
  from the soma was only weak (correlation coefficients were 0.2 and 0.26,
  respectively). 7. Compartmental models constructed from camera lucida
  drawings of eight target neurones showed that synaptic contacts were located
  at mean electrotonic distances between 0.07 and 0.33 from the soma (mean,
  0.13). Simulations of unitary EPSPs, assuming quantal conductance changes
  with fast rise time and short duration, indicated that amplitudes of quantal
  EPSPs at the soma were attenuated, on average, to $<$ 10\% of dendritic EPSPs
  and varied in amplitude up to 10-fold depending on the dendritic location of
  synaptic contacts. The inferred quantal peak conductance increase varied
  between 1.5 and 5.5 nS (mean, 3 nS). 8. The combined physiological and
  morphological measurements in conjunction with EPSP simulations indicated
  that the 20-fold range in efficacy of the synaptic connections between thick
  tufted pyramidal neurones, which have their synaptic contacts preferentially
  located on basal and apical oblique dendrites, was due to differences in
  transmitter release probability of the projecting neurones and, to a lesser
  extent, to differenc},

                   complex neuropil remain largely unknown. We search
                   for imprints of specificity in the layout of axonal
                   and dendritic arbors from the rat neocortex. An
                   analysis of 3D reconstructions of pairs consisting of
                   pyramidal cells (PCs) and GABAergic interneurons
                   (GIs) revealed that the layout of GI axons is
                   specific. This specificity is manifested in a
                   relatively high tortuosity, small branch length of
                   these axons, and correlations of their trajectories
                   with the positions of postsynaptic neuron dendrites.
                   Axons of PCs show no such specificity, usually taking
                   a relatively straight course through neuropil.
                   However, wiring patterns among PCs hold a large
                   potential for circuit remodeling and specificity
                   through growth and retraction of dendritic spines.
                   Our results define distinct class-specific rules in

                   partners to form synaptic connections. By using
                   multineuron whole-cell recordings and confocal
                   microscopy we found that axons of layer V neocortical
                   pyramidal neurons do not preferentially project
                   toward the dendrites of particular neighboring
                   pyramidal neurons; instead, axons promiscuously touch
                   all neighboring dendrites without any bias.
                   Functional synaptic coupling of a small fraction of
                   these neurons is, however, correlated with the
                   existence of synaptic boutons at existing touch
                   sites. These data provide the first direct
                   experimental evidence for a tabula rasa-like
                   structural matrix between neocortical pyramidal
                   neurons and suggests that pre- and postsynaptic
                   interactions shape the conversion between touches and
                   synapses to form specific functional microcircuits.
                   These data also indicate that the local neocortical
                   microcircuit has the potential to be differently
                   rewired without the need for remodeling axonal or
                   dendritic arbors.},

                   Here, we investigate the excitatory synaptic neuronal
                   network of an anatomically defined cortical column,
                   the C2 barrel column of mouse primary somatosensory
                   cortex. This cortical column is known to process
                   tactile information related to the C2 whisker.
                   Through multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings,
                   we quantify connectivity maps between individual
                   excitatory neurons located across all cortical layers
                   of the C2 barrel column. Synaptic connectivity
                   depended strongly upon somatic laminar location of
                   both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, providing
                   definitive evidence for layer-specific signaling
                   pathways. The strongest excitatory influence upon the
                   cortical column was provided by presynaptic layer 4
                   neurons. In all layers we found rare large-amplitude
                   synaptic connections, which are likely to contribute
                   strongly to reliable information processing. Our data
                   set provides the first functional description of the
                   excitatory synaptic wiring diagram of a
                   physiologically relevant and anatomically
                   well-defined cortical column at single-cell

                   large number of simple equivalent components (or

                   memory is described by an appropriate phase space
                   flow of the state of a system. A model of such a

                   readily adapted to integrated circuits. The

                   content-addressable memory which correctly yields an
                   entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size.

                   recent proposals that information may be carried by
                   precise spike timing have been challenged by the
                   assumption that these neurons operate in a noisy
