  abstract =      {Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate
                   that can be dynamically and arbitrarily molded by
                   experience. However, when we investigated synaptic
                   connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the
                   neocortex, we found that both connectivity and
                   synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable.
                   Synaptic weights follow very closely the number of
                   connections in a group of neurons, saturating after
                   only 20\% of possible connections are formed between
                   neurons in a group. When we examined the network
                   topology of connectivity between neurons, we found
                   that the neurons cluster into small world networks
                   that are not scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of
                   separation. We found a simple clustering rule where
                   connectivity is directly proportional to the number
                   of common neighbors, which accounts for these small
                   world networks and accurately predicts the connection
                   probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal
                   neuron network clusters into multiple groups of a few
                   dozen neurons each. The neurons composing each group
                   are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100
                   $\mu$m apart, allowing for multiple groups to be
                   interlaced in the same space. In summary, we
                   discovered a synaptic organizing principle that
                   groups neurons in a manner that is common across
                   animals and hence, independent of individual
                   experiences. We speculate that these elementary
                   neuronal groups are prescribed Lego-like building
                   blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies
                   more on combining these elementary assemblies into
                   higher-order constructs.},

                   adjacent, synaptically connected thick tufted layer 5
                   pyramidal neurones in brain slices of young rat
                   (14-16 days) somatosensory cortex to examine the
                   physiological properties of unitary EPSPs. Pre- and
                   postsynaptic neurones were filled with biocytin and
                   examined in the light and electron microscope to
                   quantify the morphology of axonal and dendritic
                   arbors and the number and location of synaptic
                   contacts on the target neurone. 2. In 138 synaptic
                   connections between pairs of pyramidal neurones 96
                   (70\%) were unidirectional and 42 (30\%) were
                   bidirectional. The probability of finding a synaptic
                   connection in dual recordings was 0.1. Unitary EPSPs
                   evoked by a single presynaptic action potential (AP)
                   had a mean peak amplitude ranging from 0.15 to 5.5 mV
                   in different connections with a mean of 1.3 +/- 1.1
                   mV, a latency of 1.7 +/- 0.9 ms, a 20-80\% rise time
                   of 2.9 +/- 2.3 ms and a decay time constant of 40 +/-
                   18 ms at 32-24 degrees C and -60 +/- 2 mV membrane
                   potential. 3. Peak amplitudes of unitary EPSPs
                   fluctuated randomly from trial to trial. The
                   coefficient of variation (c.v.) of the unitary EPSP
                   amplitudes ranged from 0.13 to 2.8 in different
                   synaptic connections (mean, 0.52; median, 0.41). The
                   percentage of failures of single APs to evoke a
                   unitary EPSP ranged from 0 to 73\% (mean, 14\%;
                   median, 7\%). Both c.v. and percentage of failures
                   decreased with increasing mean EPSP amplitude. 4.
                   Postsynaptic glutamate receptors which mediate
                   unitary EPSPs at -60 mV were predominantly of the
                       L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate
  (AMPA) receptor type. Receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type
  contributed only a small fraction ($<$ 20\%) to the voltage-time integral of
  the unitary EPSP at -60 mV, but their contribution increased at more positive
  membrane potentials. 5. Branching patterns of dendrites and axon collaterals
  of forty-five synaptically connected neurones, when examined in the light
  microscope, indicated that the axonal and dendritic anatomy of both
  projecting and target neurones and of uni- and bidirectionally connected
  neurones was uniform. 6. The number of potential synaptic contacts formed by
  a presynaptic neurone on a target neurone varied between four and eight
  (mean, 5.5 +/- 1.1 contacts; n = 19 connections). Synaptic contacts were
  preferentially located on basal dendrites (63\%, 82 +/- 35 microns from the
  soma, n = 67) and apical oblique dendrites (27\%, 145 +/- 59 microns, n =
  29), and 35\% of all contacts were located on tertiary basal dendritic
  branches. The mean geometric distances (from the soma) of the contacts of a
  connection varied between 80 and 585 microns (mean, 147 microns; median, 105
  microns). The correlation between EPSP amplitude and the number of
  morphologically determined synaptic contacts or the mean geometric distances
  from the soma was only weak (correlation coefficients were 0.2 and 0.26,
  respectively). 7. Compartmental models constructed from camera lucida
  drawings of eight target neurones showed that synaptic contacts were located
  at mean electrotonic distances between 0.07 and 0.33 from the soma (mean,
  0.13). Simulations of unitary EPSPs, assuming quantal conductance changes
  with fast rise time and short duration, indicated that amplitudes of quantal
  EPSPs at the soma were attenuated, on average, to $<$ 10\% of dendritic EPSPs
  and varied in amplitude up to 10-fold depending on the dendritic location of
  synaptic contacts. The inferred quantal peak conductance increase varied
  between 1.5 and 5.5 nS (mean, 3 nS). 8. The combined physiological and
  morphological measurements in conjunction with EPSP simulations indicated
  that the 20-fold range in efficacy of the synaptic connections between thick
  tufted pyramidal neurones, which have their synaptic contacts preferentially
  located on basal and apical oblique dendrites, was due to differences in
  transmitter release probability of the projecting neurones and, to a lesser
  extent, to differenc},

                   Through multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings,

                   excitatory neurons located across all cortical layers
                   of the C2 barrel column. Synaptic connectivity
                   depended strongly upon somatic laminar location of

                   definitive evidence for layer-specific signaling

                   connected sparse recurrent networks of spiking
                   neurons with random, overlapping inputs, to
                   investigate what functional and structural synaptic
                   plasticity mechanisms sculpt network connections into
                   the patterns measured in vitro. Our Hebbian
                   implementation of structural plasticity causes a
                   removal of connections between uncorrelated

                   performance in a behavioral readout of the networks'
                   ability to complete the task. A plasticity mechanism
                   operating on inhibitory connections, long-term
                   potentiation of inhibition, when combined with
                   structural plasticity, indirectly enhances clustering
                   of excitatory cells via excitatory connections. A
                   rate-dependent (triplet) form of
                   spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) between
                   excitatory cells is less effective and basic STDP is
                   detrimental. Clustering also arises in networks
                   stimulated with single stimuli and in networks
                   undergoing raised levels of spontaneous activity when
                   structural plasticity is combined with functional
                   plasticity. In conclusion, spatially intertwined
                   clusters or cliques of connected excitatory cells can
                   arise via a Hebbian form of structural plasticity

                   (EPSPs) and 37 and 26 inhibitory postsynaptic
                   potentials (IPSPs), respectively. Patterns of
                   connectivity and synaptic properties were similar in
                   the two species, although differences of scale and in
                   the range of morphologies were observed. Excitatory
                   `forward' projections from layer 4 to 3, like those
                   from layer 3 to 5, targeted pyramidal cells and a
                   small proportion of interneurons, while excitatory
                   `back' projections from layer 3 to 4 selected
                   interneurons, including parvalbumin immuno-positive
                   basket cells. Layer 4 interneurons that inhibited
                   layer 3 pyramidal cells included both basket cells
                   and dendrite-targeting cells. Large interneurons,
                   resembling cells previously described as large basket
                   cells, in layers 4 and 3 (cat), with long myelinated
                   horizontal axon collaterals received frequent
                   excitatory inputs from both layers. A very high rate
                   of connectivity was observed between pairs of
                   interneurons, often with quite different
                   morphologies, and the resultant IPSPs, like the EPSPs
                   recorded in interneurons, were brief compared with
                   those recorded in pyramidal and spiny stellate
                   cells.},

                   how connection patterns between neurons relate to
                   their function. On a coarse scale, long-range
                   projections can preferentially link cortical regions
                   with similar responses to sensory stimuli. But on the
                   local scale, where dendrites and axons overlap
                   substantially, the functional specificity of
                   connections remains unknown. Here we determine
                   synaptic connectivity between nearby layer 2/3
                   pyramidal neurons in vitro, the response properties
                   of which were first characterized in mouse visual
                   cortex in vivo. We found that connection probability
                   was related to the similarity of visually driven
                   neuronal activity. Neurons with the same preference
                   for oriented stimuli connected at twice the rate of
                   neurons with orthogonal orientation preferences.
                   Neurons responding similarly to naturalistic stimuli
                   formed connections at much higher rates than those
                   with uncorrelated responses. Bidirectional synaptic
                   connections were found more frequently between
                   neuronal pairs with strongly correlated visual

                   functional specificity of local synaptic connections
                   in the visual cortex, and point to the existence of
                   fine-scale subnetworks dedicated to processing

                   complex neuropil remain largely unknown. We search
                   for imprints of specificity in the layout of axonal
                   and dendritic arbors from the rat neocortex. An
                   analysis of 3D reconstructions of pairs consisting of
                   pyramidal cells (PCs) and GABAergic interneurons
                   (GIs) revealed that the layout of GI axons is
                   specific. This specificity is manifested in a
                   relatively high tortuosity, small branch length of
                   these axons, and correlations of their trajectories
                   with the positions of postsynaptic neuron dendrites.
                   Axons of PCs show no such specificity, usually taking
                   a relatively straight course through neuropil.

                   understand the full scope of this capacity, it is
                   essential to know how neurons choose particular
                   partners to form synaptic connections. By using
                   multineuron whole-cell recordings and confocal
                   microscopy we found that axons of layer V neocortical
                   pyramidal neurons do not preferentially project
                   toward the dendrites of particular neighboring
                   pyramidal neurons; instead, axons promiscuously touch
                   all neighboring dendrites without any bias.
                   Functional synaptic coupling of a small fraction of
                   these neurons is, however, correlated with the
                   existence of synaptic boutons at existing touch
                   sites. These data provide the first direct
                   experimental evidence for a tabula rasa-like
                   structural matrix between neocortical pyramidal
                   neurons and suggests that pre- and postsynaptic
                   interactions shape the conversion between touches and
                   synapses to form specific functional microcircuits.
                   These data also indicate that the local neocortical
                   microcircuit has the potential to be differently

                   sometimes bidirectional, among a lot of weak
                   connections. To explain these connectivity patterns,
                   we created a model of spike
                   timing\textendash{}dependent plasticity (STDP) in
                   which synaptic changes depend on presynaptic spike
                   arrival and the postsynaptic membrane potential,
                   filtered with two different time constants. Our model
                   describes several nonlinear effects that are observed
                   in STDP experiments, as well as the voltage
                   dependence of plasticity. We found that, in a
                   simulated recurrent network of spiking neurons, our
                   plasticity rule led not only to development of
                   localized receptive fields but also to connectivity
                   patterns that reflect the neural code. For temporal
                   coding procedures with spatio-temporal input
                   correlations, strong connections were predominantly
                   unidirectional, whereas they were bidirectional under
                   rate-coded input with spatial correlations only.
                   Thus, variable connectivity patterns in the brain
                   could reflect different coding principles across
                   brain areas; moreover, our simulations suggested that
