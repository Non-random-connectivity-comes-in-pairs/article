However, even when pairs . This can be demonstrated by considering a model of in which .

Consider for this that connection probabilities $P_{ij}$ are distributed according to some probability density function $f_{P_{ij}}$. We assume in the following that $i > j$ without restriction. The expected probability of a reciprocal connection within a pair can be expressed as
%
\begin{align}
  \E(P_{ij}P_{ji}) = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 xy\, f_{P_{ij},P_{ji}}(x,y) \, dx\, dy, \label{eq:dbint}
\end{align}
%
where $f_{P_{ij},P_{ji}}(x,y)$ is the joint probability density function of $P_{ij}$ and $P_{ji}$, 
%
\begin{align}
  f_{P_{ij},P_{ji}}(x,y) =  f_{P_{ji} | P_{ij}}(y \mid x) f_{P_{ij}}(x). \label{eq:cdf_def}
\end{align}
%
In the case that $P_{ij}$ and $P_{ji}$ are independent we have $f_{P_{ji} | P_{ij}}(y \mid x) = f_{P_{ji}}(y)$ and in the case of $P_{ij}=P_{ji}$ it is $f_{P_{ji} | P_{ij}}(y \mid x) = \delta(y-x)$. Here we propose a model for the conditional density function that transitions between the two extreme cases by multiplying $f_{P_{ji}}(y)$ with the density function of a normal distribution centered around $x$,
%
\begin{align}
  f_{P_{ji} | P_{ij}} (y \mid x) = \frac{1}{N_{\sigma}(x)} f_{P_{ji}}(y)\, \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \,e^{\frac{(y-x)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \label{eq:fpijpji},
\end{align}
%
where the additional factor $N_{\sigma}(x)^{-1}$  makes sure that $f_{P_{ji}|P_{ij}} (y \mid x)$ integrates to one,
%
\begin{align}
  N_{\sigma}(x) = \int_0^1 f_{P_{ji}}(z)\, \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}\, e^{\frac{(z-x)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \,dz.
\end{align}
%
Indeed, as the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the modulating normal distribution increases $f_{P_{ji}|P_{ij}} (y \mid x) \to f_{P_{ji}}(y)$ and in the limit $\sigma \to 0$ we have
\begin{align}
  \lim_{\sigma \to 0}   f_{P_{ji}|P_{ij}} (y \mid x) = \delta(y-x).
\end{align}
%
In Figure~\ref{fig:sym_fail}A  conditional density functions for various $\sigma$ are shown for the truncated gamma distribution. For low values of $\sigma$ the conditional density function resembles a narrow Gaussian around $x$, reflecting approximately symmetric connection probabilities. For $\sigma > 1$ on the other hand $f_{P_{ji} | P_{ij}}(y \mid x)$ becomes virtually indistinguishable from $f^T_{\alpha, \beta}(y)$, signifying independence of $P_{ji}$ from $P_{ij}$.

Finally we employ the model to examine how the relative overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\varrho$ changes with the degree of symmetry in the connection probabilities within a pair of neurons. For this $\varrho$ is computed as a function of $\sigma$ as for a given distribution of $P_{ij}$ as
%
\begin{align}
  \varrho = \frac{\E(P_{ij} P_{ji})}{\mu^2}, \label{eq:rho_sigma}
\end{align}
%
where the numerator is given by \eqref{eq:dbint} with %\eqref{eq:cdf_def} and
\eqref{eq:fpijpji} %,
%
%% \begin{align}
%%   \E(P_{ij}P_{ji}) = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 xy\, f_{P_{ij}}(x) \frac{1}{N_{\sigma}(x)} f_{P_{ji}}(y)\, \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} \,e^{\frac{(y-x)^2}{2 \sigma^2}} \, dx\, dy,  
%% \end{align}
%
and the overall connection probability $\mu$ is calculated as
%
\begin{align}
 \mu = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 x f_{P_{ij}}(x)\,dx + \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 f_{P_{ij}}(x) \int_0^1 y \,f_{P_{ji}\vert P_{ij}}(y \mid x) \,dy \, dx.
\end{align}
%

Figure~\ref{fig:sym_fail}B shows the change of $\varrho$ with $\sigma$ for connection probabilities $P_{ij}$ following a truncated gamma distribution $\Gamma^T(\alpha, \beta)$. For the three parameters sets chosen, we can show that a strong overrepresentation of bidirectional connections . In fact as along

For $\alpha = 0.248$ random variables with the respective probability density functions were sampled and the average $\varrho$ was computed via \eqref{eq:rho_sigma} using the sample means.
