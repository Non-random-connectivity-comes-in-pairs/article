The overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\varrho$ in a network is maximal when every connected pair is already a reciprocally connected pair. In terms of the model defined above, this is the case when
\begin{align}
\E(P_{ij} P_{ji}) = \E(P_{ij}).
\end{align}
%
The relative occurrence of reciprocal connections from \eqref{eq:rho} then becomes
\begin{align}
\varrho = \frac{1}{\E(P_{ij})} = \frac{1}{\mu} \label{eq:rho_max}
\end{align}
Thus for local cortical circuits of L5 pyramidal neurons with a typical connection probability of $\mu = 0.1$ \cite{Thomson2002,Song2005}, the network model yields a maximal overrepresentation of $\varrho = 10$.
