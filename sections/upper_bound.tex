The overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\varrho$ in a network is maximal when every connected pair is already a reciprocally connected pair. In terms of the model defined above, this is the case when
\begin{align}
\E(P_{ij} P_{ji}) = \E(P_{ij}).
\end{align}
%
The relative occurrence of reciprocal connections from \eqref{eq:rho} then becomes
\begin{align}
\varrho = \frac{1}{\E(P_{ij})} = \frac{1}{\mu} \label{eq:rho_max}
\end{align}
Thus, for local cortical circuits of L5 pyramidal neurons with a typical connection probability of $\mu = 0.1$ \cite{Thomson2002,Song2005}, the network model yields a maximal overrepresentation of $\varrho = 10$. While this theoretical maximum is unlikely to exist in actual cortical networks, the precise degree of overrepresentation will depend on the specific distribution of connection probabilities in the network. In the following, we study two generic examples.
