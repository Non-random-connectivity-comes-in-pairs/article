Given a network $\mathcal{G}$ with $N$ vertices and $|E|$ connections (no self-loops, no parallel connections).

The overall connection probability is
\[
\bar{p} := \frac{|E|}{N(N-1)}
\]

Then, the overexpression as typically measured in experimental studies is given as
\[
o_{\mathcal{G}} = \frac{|\{\textrm{reciprocal pairs}\}|}{\binom{N}{2} \bar{p}^2}
\]

The overexpression $o_{\mathcal{G}}$ is maximal, when the number of reciprocal connections is maximal. In a graph with $|E|$ connections, this is the case when every connected pair is already bidirectionally connected:
\[
|\{\textrm{reciprocal pairs}\}| = \frac{|E|}{2}.
\]
Here we assumed that $|E|$ is even for simplicity. With this we obtain an upper bound for the overrepresentation of bidirectional connections in the network:
%
\[
o_{\mathcal{G}}^{max} = \frac{\frac{|E|}{2}}{\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \bar{p}^2} = \frac{N(N-1)}{|E|} = \frac{1}{\bar{p}}.
\]
