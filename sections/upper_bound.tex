The overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\varrho$ is maximal when every connected pair in the network is already a reciprocally connected pair, that is when
\begin{align}
\E(P_{ij}^2) = \E(P_{ij}).
\end{align}
%
In this case the overrepresentation is
\begin{align}
\varrho = \frac{1}{\E(P_{ij})} = \frac{1}{\mu}.
\end{align}
Thus, in the local cortical circuits of L5 pyramidal neurons with a typical connection probability of $\mu = 0.1$ \cite{Thomson2002,Song2005} the maximal overrepresentation is $\varrho = 10$.
