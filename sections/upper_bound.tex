The overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\varrho$ is maximal when every connected pair in the network is already a reciprocally connected pair, that is when
\[
\E(P_{ij}^2) = \E(P_{ij}).
\]
[Comment: The only distributions of $P_{ij}$ that satisfy this identity are distributions in which $P_{ij}=1$ and $P_{ij}=0$ are the only events occurring with non-zero probability. In other words, the overrepresentation is maximal in a fully deterministic network in which every connected pair bidirectionally connected.]
%
In this case the overrepresentation is
\[
\varrho = \frac{1}{\E(P_{ij})} = \frac{1}{\mu}.
\]
Thus, in local cortical networks with a typical connection probability of $\mu = 0.1$ the maximal overrepresentation is $\varrho = 10$.
