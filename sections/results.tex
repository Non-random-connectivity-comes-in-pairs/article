%% Consider a network with nodes $x_1,\dots,x_{N}$. Let there be a connection from node $x_i$ to $x_j$ with probability $P_{ij}$. Typically, . However, it is highly unlikely that all nodes are connected with the same probability. 

%% Thus let the $P_{ij}$ be identically distributed continuous random variables with values in $[0,1]$. We write the of probability density function of the $P_{ij}$ as $f_{P_{ij}}$.

The emergence of non-random connectivity patterns can be modeled by
assigning each possible connection from a node $i$ to a node $j$ in a
random graph a separate probability $P_{ij}$ to exist.
%
In such a model some connections are more likely to be realized than
others, allowing for the encoding of patterns within the specific
probabilities of each connection.
%
In the limiting case each connection either exists or is absent with
certainty, $P_{ij} \in \{0,1\}$, presenting a blueprint for the
network architecture.
%

%
To analyze the effect of non-random structures within a network,
specifically on the statistics of bidirectionally connected pairs
found in the network, we consider a random graph model of $N$ neurons
in which a connection from node $i$ to node $j$ with $i \neq j$ exists with
probability $P_{ij}$.
%
Here the $(P_{ij})_{I}$, where  $I = \{(i,j) \mid i,j = 1,\dots,N\, \textrm{and}\, i \neq j\}$, are identically
distributed random variables in $[0,1]$, yielding a probability of
connection for each ordered pair of nodes in the graph. % Below we're assuming $i \neq j $ in all cases.
% where we
%always assume $i \neq as it does not make sense to consider
%bidirectional connectivity in
%% self-connections.
%

%
Given the $(P_{ij})_I$, what is then the probability in
this model for a random node to have a projection to another random
node in the network?
%
We compute this overall connection probability $\mu$ easily as the
expected value of~$P_{ij}$,
\begin{align}
\mu = \E(P_{ij}).
\end{align}
%
%% Here, we are interested in the probability $P_{\mathbf{bidir}}$ of finding In a random pair of neurons, the probability  to find a bidirectional connection is the expected value of the product of $P=P_{ij}$ and $Q=P_{ji}$. With their respective density functions $f_P$, $f_Q$ and their joint probability density function $f_{PQ}$ we have
%
%
In this work we are interested in the probability $P_{\mathbf{bidir}}$
of a bidirectional connection to exist in a random pair of neurons.
%
We determine $P_{\mathbf{bidir}}$ as the expected value of the product
of $P_{ij}$ and $P_{ji}$,
%
\begin{align}
P_{\mathbf{bidir}} = \E(P_{ij} P_{ji}).
\end{align}
%
The relative occurrence $\varrho$ of such reciprocally connected pairs compares $P_{\mathbf{bidir}}$ with the occurrence of bidirectional pairs in an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph, in which each unidirectional connection is equally likely to occur with probability $\mu$ \cite{Gilbert1959, Erdos1959}. The probability of a particular bidirectional connection to exist in such a random graph is simply $\mu^2$ and we obtain the relative occurrence as the quotient
%% To answer the question if this probability is deviates from the proabibility than we would expect . The probability of a bidirectional in this standard random graph is $\mu$. We can the overrepresentation of as the quotient of $
\begin{align}
\varrho = \frac{P_{\mathbf{bidir}}}{\mu^2} = \frac{\E(P_{ij}P_{ji})}{{\E\left(P_{ij}\right)}^2}.
\end{align}
%
Experimental studies in local cortical circuits of rodents have repeatedly reported a relative occurrence of bidirectional connections $\varrho > 1$ \cite{Markram1997, Song2005, Perin2011}. To understand in which cases such an overrepresentations occurs, we consider two cases. In the first case, assume that the random variables $P_{ij}$ and $P_{ji}$ are independent. Then
\begin{align}
\E(P_{ij} P_{ji}) = \E(P_{ij})\,\E(P_{ji}) = \E(P_{ij})^2,
\end{align}
and we expect to observe no overrepresentation of reciprocal connections, $\varrho = 1$. However, if in the second case connection probabilities are symmetric in pairs, $P_{ij} = P_{ji}$, then 
\begin{align}
P_{\mathbf{bidir}} = \E(P_{ij}^2).
\end{align}
%
The relative occurrence of reciprocal connections becomes
\begin{align}
\varrho = \frac{\E(P_{ij}^2)}{{\E\left(P_{ij}\right)}^2}
\end{align}
and we note that any distribution of $P_{ij}$ with a nonvanishing variance will lead to a relative occurrence that deviates from the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph, as
\begin{align}
\Var(P_{ij}) = \E(P_{ij}^2) - \E\left(P_{ij}\right)^2.
\end{align}
As $x \mapsto x^2$ is a strictly convex function, Jensen's inequality \cite{Jensen1906, Cover2006} yields
\begin{align}
\E(P_{ij}^2) \geq \E(P_{ij})^2, \label{eq:jensen}
\end{align}
and we find that $\varrho \geq 1$ in networks with symmetric connection probabilities. Jensen's inequality further states that equality in \eqref{eq:jensen}, and thus $\varrho = 1$, holds if and only if $P_{ij}$ is constant. As a central result of this study we thus find that any deviation of the distribution of the symmetric connection probabilities $P_{ij}$ from a constant value $p$, we say that $P_{ij}$ is a non-degenerate distribution, necessarily induces an an overrepresentation of bidirectional connections in the network, $\varrho > 1$. In other words, in a network where some pairs are more likely connected than others, the count of expected reciprocally connected pairs is strictly underestimated by the statistics of an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi graph with same overall connection probability $\E(P_{ij}) = \mu$.
