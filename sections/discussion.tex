* Summary of the results:

* Symmetry: Distance dependent networks (Song vs. Perin),

* Overrepresentation of bidirectional emerges as a \enquote{symptom} of \underline{any} non-random connectivity $+$ symmetric connectivity, thus not necessarily an intrinsic parameter of network connectivity

* Research question should thus possibly focus more on 1) higher order non-random structures or 2) weights of connectivity (example: bidirectionally connected pairs typically have strong weights). 

* Absence of overrepresentation of bidirectional does not necessarily allow conclusion that network is completely random, might be asymmetric in connection probabilities. However, an absence of overrepresentation could can be hint towards either a close to random network or network that has strong asymmetry.

* Absence of bidirectional connection overrepresentation was found, I think, in barrel cortex by \cite{Lefort2009}. \cc{check this!}
