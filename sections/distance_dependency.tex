Connection probabilities have been found to be distance-dependent in local cortical networks \cite{Perin2011}.

In a network with on a square of edge length $a$ are, Assume a distance-dependent connectivity profile $g(r)$, giving a connection probability $g(r) \in [0,1]$ for every possible inter-node distance $0 \leq r \leq a \sqrt{2}$.

To find the probability density function of the distribution of connection probabilities $f_{P}(p)$, we need to know how often certain distances occur in the random network. In other words, the probability density function for the distance between two random points on a square is needed.
