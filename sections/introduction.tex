%% Non-random network connectivity in a random graph can be modeled by assigning each connection a separate probability to exist. Some connections are more likely to be realized in the network, some less. In the limiting case a blue print. Here we assume a network with 

* The wiring of brain networks is important for functional processes (which, how?)

* How does the brain establish these connections? Increasing evidence suggests that microcircuitry is highly non-random \cite{Song2005,Perin2011}. Thus not every connection is equally like established, rather some connections are more likely connected than others.

* A specific topic of interest is the overrepresentation of bidirectional connections \cite{Markram1997,Song2005}. Explanation of what overrepresentation means.

* Review of different studies that studied the emergence or functional implicatioins of recip connections (for example \cite{Clopath2010})

* In this theoretical work we study non-random network connectivity in a network model in which each connection has separate probability to exist.

* brain process

* If this process follows patterns in which both directions of connection within a pair are equally likely, we show that bidirectional connections are necessarily occurring more often than in a network in which each connection is equally likely.
