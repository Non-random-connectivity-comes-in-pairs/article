%% Non-random network connectivity in a random graph can be modeled by assigning each connection a separate probability to exist. Some connections are more likely to be realized in the network, some less. In the limiting case a blue print. Here we assume a network with 

* connectivity is important for functional processes

* How does the brain establish these connections? Increasing evidence suggests that microcircuitry is highly non-random \cite{Song2005,Perin2011}. Thus not every connection is equally like established, rather some connections [...] If this process follows patterns in which both directions of connection within a pair are equally likely, we show that bidirectional connections are necessarily occurring more often than in a network in which each connection is equally likely.
