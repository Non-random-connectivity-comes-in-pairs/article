Non-random network connectivity in a random graph can be modeled by assigning each connection a separate probability to exist. Some connections are more likely to be realized in the network, some less. In the limiting case a blue print. Here we assume a network with 

How does the brain establish its connections? Increasing evidence suggests that microcircuitry is highly non-random \cite{Song2005,Perin2011}. If the process follows patterns in which both directions of connection within a pair are equally likely, bidirectional connections are necessarily overrepresented.
