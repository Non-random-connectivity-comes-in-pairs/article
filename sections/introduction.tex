How does the brain establish these connections? Increasing evidence implies that cortical microcircuitry is highly structured \cite{Song2005,Perin2011}. These experimental studies suggest that not every connection is equally likely to be established, rather some pairs of neurons are more likely connected than others. Here, the relative occurrence of bidirectionally connected pairs has been of particular interest. Comparing the amount of reciprocally connected pairs as one would expect to find in an equivalent random network with the number of bidirectionally connected pairs identified by paired whole-cell recordings in cortical slices, a relative overrepresentation of such bidirectional pairs has been reported for layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex \cite{Song2005} and layer 5 pyramidal cells in the rat somatosensory cortex \cite{Markram1997,Perin2011}.

The prevalence of bidirectional connectivity has since been established as an important measure for the non-randomness of a network. However, the exact relationship between non-randomness and relative reciprocity of pairs has not been explained. Here, we model cortical circuitry with random network in which each possible connection has a separate probability to exist. Using this model we're able to show that in network in which

* In this theoretical work we study non-random network connectivity in a network model in which each connection has a separate probability to exist.

* In cortical circuits connection probabilities might be affected by many different parameters: interneuron distance, age, location,...

* If the processes in neural circuits that affect connection probability are symmetric, that is projection to a specific target is as likely as receiving input from this target, we show that bidirectional connections are necessarily occurring more often than in a random network as long as some connections are more likely than others.
