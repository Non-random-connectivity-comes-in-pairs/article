The expected overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\sigma$ is maximal, when every connected pair in the network is already a reciprocally connected pair, that is when
\[
\E(P_{ij}^2) = \E(P_{ij}).
\]
n
%% (The only distributions that satisfy this identity are distribution where $P_{ij}=1$ and $P_{ij}=0$ only with non-zero probability.)

In this case the overrepresentation is
\[
\sigma = \frac{1}{\E(P_{ij})} = \frac{1}{\bar{p}}.
\]
Thus, in local cortical networks with a typical connection probability of $\bar{p} = 0.1$ the maximal overrepresentation is $\sigma = 10$.
