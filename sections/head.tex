\begin{abstract}
Overrepresentation of bidirectional connections in local cortical networks has been repeatedly reported and has been in the focus of the discussion of non-random connectivity. Here we show in a brief mathematical analysis, that in a network in which connection probabilities are symmetric in pairs, $P_{ij} = P_{ji}$, the relative occurrence of bidirectional connections and non-random structures are inherently linked; an overabundance of reciprocally connected pairs emerges necessarily when the network structure deviates from a random network.
