In contrast to the discrete two-point distribution, we also analyzed the relative overrepresentation of bidirectional connections in a network with continuously distributed connection probabilities. In identifying a suited parameterized distribution, a main criterion was that it would allow the variation of the distribution's variance while keeping the mean constant. The gamma distribution was picked as it not only fulfills criterion but also features the exponential distribution as a special case.

Here we consider a slight modification to the traditional gamma distribution in the form of a truncated version. Let $\alpha, \beta > 0$. A random variable $X$ follows the truncated gamma distribution $\Gamma^T(\alpha, \beta)$ if it has the probability density function 
%
\begin{align}
  f_{\alpha,\beta}(x) = \begin{cases} K_{\alpha, \beta}\,
\frac{1}{\beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)}\, x^{\alpha-1}\,e^{-x/\beta} & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\end{align}
%
The factor $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ is needed due to the truncation of the probability density function for $x>0$ to ensure that
\begin{align}
  \int f_{\alpha,\beta}(x) \,dx = 1. \label{eq:gd1}
\end{align}
The value of $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ is the inverse of the cumulative probability $x \leq 1$ of the untruncated gamma distribution,
\begin{align}
  K_{\alpha,\beta} = \left(\int_0^{1} \frac{1}{\beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)}\, x^{\alpha-1}\,e^{-x/\beta} \, dx \right)^{-1}.
\end{align}
With this the equality~\eqref{eq:gd1} clearly holds. Consider then the above network model in which the connection probabilities $P_{ij}$ are $\Gamma^T(\alpha, \beta)$ distributed. As $K_{\alpha,\beta}$ is a constant for fixed $\alpha$ and $\beta$, many results on the standard gamma distribution can be adapted to the truncated version by multiplication with $K_{\alpha,\beta}$. We note the following results for the overall connection probability $\mu$,
%
\begin{align}
 \mu = \E(P_{ij}) = K_{\alpha,\beta} \, \alpha \beta, \label{eq:gd3}
\end{align}
and the expected occurrence of bidirectional connections
\begin{align}
  \E(P_{ij}^2) = K_{\alpha,\beta} \, (\alpha^2 \beta^2 + \alpha \beta^2).
\end{align}
%
The overrepresentation is then
\begin{align}
  \varrho & = \frac{\E(P_{ij}^2)}{\E(P_{ij})^2} =% \frac{\alpha^2 \beta^2}{\alpha^2 \beta^2} + \frac{\alpha \beta^2}{\alpha^2 \beta^2} =
 \frac{1}{K_{\alpha,\beta}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{\alpha}\right).
\end{align}

\caption{Probability density functions of the truncated gamma distribution for different shape parameters $\alpha$ and the induced relative overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\varrho$ in a network with such distributed connection probabilities $P_{ij}$. For given $\alpha$ the parameter $\beta$ was estimated numerically to yield $\mu \approx 0.1$ in all distributions shown.}

\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:gd} probability density functions for multiple parameter sets $(\alpha, \beta)$ are shown. The rate parameter $\beta$ is determined by the given $\alpha$ and $\mu = 0.1$ through the relation in \eqref{eq:gd1}. [Comment: I'm not sure it's worth deriving an expression for $\beta$. A good approximation is $\beta = \frac{\mu}{\alpha}$, ($K_{\alpha,\beta} = 1$). I just need to make it clear what I'm doing.]
The narrower the probability density around the mean $\mu = 0.1$ the smaller is the expected overrepresentation of bidirectional connections $\varrho$ in the network. To achieve a high $\varrho$ many pairs with a high connection probability are needed. The dashed line in Figure~\ref{fig:gd} marks the probability density function of the probability distribution of connection probabilities $P_{ij}$ that induce an overrepresentation of reciprocal pairs of $\varrho = 4$ as found by \textcite{Song2005} leading to a highly skewed distribution with a long tail. The relevance of such a distribution for cortical networks however is debatable, as most connections are with a high certainty not established seemingly wasting the network's potential for different possible configurations.
